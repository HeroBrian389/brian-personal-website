# Setting Up Your Quotes Database in Notion

## Step 1: Create the Database

1. Create a new page in Notion
2. Type `/table` and select "Table - Full page"
3. Name it "Quotes Database"

## Step 2: Set Up Properties

Add these properties to your database:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| Quote | Title | The main quote text |
| Author | Text | Person who said/wrote it |
| Source | Text | Book, speech, movie, etc. |
| Tags | Multi-select | Categories (wisdom, life, love, etc.) |
| Date Added | Date | When you added the quote |
| Favorite | Checkbox | Mark your favorites |
| Notes | Text | Any additional context |

## Step 3: Import Your Quotes

I've created a CSV file (`quotes-for-notion.csv`) that you can import:

1. In your new Notion database, click the "..." menu
2. Select "Import" → "CSV"
3. Upload the `quotes-for-notion.csv` file
4. Map the columns to your properties

## Step 4: Update Your Code

Once you have the database set up, we'll need to:
1. Get the database ID (found in the URL when viewing the database)
2. Update the quotes service to use Notion's database API
3. This will give us structured data with consistent formatting

## Example Database Entry

| Quote | Author | Source | Tags | Favorite |
|-------|--------|--------|------|----------|
| "The unexamined life is not worth living" | Socrates | Apology | wisdom, life, philosophy | ✓ |
| "One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple" | Jack Kerouac | The Dharma Bums | writing, simplicity | ✓ |

## Benefits of Using a Database

1. **Structured Data**: Each quote has consistent fields
2. **Easy Filtering**: Filter by author, tags, favorites
3. **Better API Access**: Notion's database API returns structured data
4. **Rich Features**: Add ratings, categories, related quotes
5. **Easy Maintenance**: Add/edit quotes directly in Notion

## Tag Suggestions

Based on your quotes, here are suggested tags:
- wisdom
- life
- love
- mortality/death
- time
- art/creativity
- philosophy
- literature
- humor
- success
- suffering
- spirituality

## Next Steps
